# Animal Crossing New Horizon item browser in SwiftUI!

This is a browser for Animal Crossing New Horizon items. 

Pretty barebone as of now but you can browse items by categories and search them. 

This is just a very simple SwiftUI application, all the database hard work have been done on the [master sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hxrdp7oxtK-J5x9u1-rzChUpLtkv3t0_kNGdS6dtyWI/edit#gid=2031086626) by the community. 

And [u/Azarro](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azarro/) made an awesome JSON API from that google sheet. (private for now).

As the API is private the app use a local dump of the API at the moment. 

You can use this application for learning about SwiftUI and Combine. It use a very standard view, and view model architecture with full use of @State, @Binding, @Published, Observed and Observable object.
