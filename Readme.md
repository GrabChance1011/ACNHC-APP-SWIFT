# Animal Crossing New Horizon item browser in SwiftUI!

This is a browser for Animal Crossing New Horizon items. 

Pretty barebone as of now but you can browse items by categories and search them. 

You can use this application for learning about SwiftUI and Combine. It use a very standTrd view, and view model architecture with full use of @State, @Binding, @Published, Observed and Observable object. 

## Credits

This is just a very simple SwiftUI application, all the database hard work have been done on the [master sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hxrdp7oxtK-J5x9u1-rzChUpLtkv3t0_kNGdS6dtyWI/edit#gid=2031086626) by the community. 

And [u/Azarro](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azarro/) made an awesome JSON API from that google sheet. (private for now).

As the API is private the app use a local dump of the API at the moment.
